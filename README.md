# 👋 Hi, I’m @Sylvestersj9

I'm a hands-on automation enthusiast with a background in social care and a passion for leveraging **AI** to streamline operations and solve real-world problems.

  - AI-powered workflow automation (n8n, Zapier alternatives)
  - Building voice and chat-based AI assistants
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for document Q&A
  - Automation in healthcare, social care, and supported living environments

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Advanced PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for vector search
  - Building low-latency AI workflows using `Ollama`, `Supabase`, and `n8n`
  - Scalable chatbot architectures for WhatsApp and Telegram

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open source tools for automating repetitive admin work
  - Ethical AI systems in care, education, or professional services
  - Projects involving LLMs, embeddings, or document intelligence
